I am a Researcher at Sichuan University, China. I was a postdoc in EECS/DCS at KTH, under the supervision of [Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/).  Prior to that, I was a postdoc in CS at RPI, advised by [Prof. Stacy Patterson](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~pattes3/). I received my PhD degree from CS at Fudan University in 2019, advised by [Prof. Zhongzhi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=DrcEuSkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I did my undergraduate study also in CS at Fudan.

I have broad research interests ranging from foundations of computer science to trends in artificial intelligence. During my PhD and postdocs, I primarily worked in decision making algorithms in network systems, e.g. network control systems, distributed learning systems, social networks, and epidemic spreading. Proving theorems was a significant part of my previous work.

After joining Sichuan University, my research foci have shifted to Machine Learning and its applications. I am fortunate to work with the big [DICA](https://github.com/dicalab-scu) team. Our group aims to build reliable models from data using GPUs, and provide guarantees whenever possible. Recently, I work on computational pathology and trustworthy AI systems, paying more attention to engineering considerations.
