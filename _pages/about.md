I am a Researcher at Sichuan University, China. I was a postdoc in EECS/DCS at KTH, under the supervision of <u><a href="https://people.kth.se/~kallej/">Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson</a></u>.  Prior to that, I was a postdoc in CS at RPI, advised by <u><a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~pattes3/">Prof. Stacy Patterson</a></u>. I received my PhD degree from CS at Fudan University in 2019, advised by <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=DrcEuSkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Zhongzhi Zhang</a></u>. I did my undergraduate study also in CS at Fudan.

I have broad research interests ranging from foundations in computer science to trends in artificial intelligence. During my PhD and postdocs, I primarily work in decision making algorithms in network systems, e.g. network control systems, distributed learning systems, social networks, and epidemic spreading. Proving theorems was a significant part of my previous work.

After joining Sichuan University, my research foci have shifted to Machine Leanring and its applications. I am grateful to work in the [DICA](https://github.com/dicalab-scu) team. We aim to build reliable models from data using GPUs, and provide guarantees whenever possible. Recently, I work on computational pathology and trustworthy AI systems.
