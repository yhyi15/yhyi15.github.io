I am a Researcher at Sichuan University, China. I was a postdoc in EECS/DCS at KTH, under the supervision of <u><a href="https://people.kth.se/~kallej/">Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson</a></u>.  Prior to that, I was a postdoc in CS at RPI, advised by <u><a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~pattes3/">Prof. Stacy Patterson</a></u>. I received my PhD degree from CS at Fudan University in 2019, advised by <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=DrcEuSkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Zhongzhi Zhang</a></u>. I did my undergraduate study also in CS at Fudan. My research interests are in decision making algorithms in network systems, e.g. network control systems, distributed learning systems, social networks, and epidemic spreading.

Most recently, I also work on computational pathology and healthcare AI systems.
