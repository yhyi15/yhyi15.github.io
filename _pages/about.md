I am an Appointed Researcher (tenure track) in College of Computer Science at Sichuan University, China. I was a postdoc in EECS/DCS at KTH, under the supervision of <u><a href="https://people.kth.se/~kallej/">Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson</a></u>. I was a postdoc in CS at RPI, advised by <u><a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~pattes3/">Prof. Stacy Patterson</a></u>. I received my PhD degree from CS at Fudan University in 2019, advised by <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=DrcEuSkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Zhongzhi Zhang</a></u>. I did my undergraduate study also in CS at Fudan. My research interests are in decision making algorithms in network systems, e.g. network control systems, social networks, and epidemic spreading.
